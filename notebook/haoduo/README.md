In our team's first meeting, we discussed the initial post made by Eric. His initial idea was to design a gesture controller compatible with all robots. TA suggested us to narrow our topic by choosing a specific robot. We decided to use the robot from Illini RoboMaster, which they were most familiar with. We made another post and successfully gained TA's approval.
