# 2022-01-31 	Project Approval
In our team's first meeting, we discussed the initial post made by Eric. His initial idea was to design a gesture controller compatible with all robots. TA suggested us to narrow our topic by choosing a specific robot. We decided to use the robot from Illini RoboMaster, which they were most familiar with. We made another post and successfully gained TA's approval.

I created our initial block diagram. It was simple, contained the subsystems we needed. Our main focus was gesture data gathering and recognition. 

# 2022-02-14 	Design Document & Review
We continued to work on the design document and attended the design review. TA offered a lot of suggestions. I studied a project from the previous semester about a glove that controlled drones. They used it to simulate the function of a mouse. We explained our logic to the head TA and asked him about the use of PCB. Our thought was to use a development board called Arduino ATmega328P, but this would not satisfy senior design's requirements. So we decided to build our own board.
